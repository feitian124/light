    	This is an easy to use lighting tool, using the phone screen and camera led.\n\n
    	When using the screen as light, the screen will not dim unless you quit or switch off.\n
    	When using the led as light, the led will keep a notification in the notification bar to remind you.\n
    	you can slide on the screen to toggle light.\n\n
